          The MULTI workshop series is the premier venue for researchers and practitioners working on multi-level
          modeling and multi-level software development. Multi-level modeling represents a new object-oriented paradigm
          for both conceptual modelling and software engineering. In contrast to conventional two-level approaches, it
          supports an unbounded number of classification levels and introduces concepts and mechanisms that foster
          reuse, adaptability, and control. While multi-level languages and tools have reached considerable maturity,
          the field still offers numerous challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          The MULTI workshop series aims at providing a platform for exchanging ideas and promoting further development
          of multi-level languages, methods, and tools. A particular goal is to encourage the community to, beyond
          proposing new approaches, analyse different approaches to multi-level modelling and define objective ways to
          evaluate their respective strengths and weaknesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <b>12<sup>th</sup> International Workshop on Multi-Level Modeling (MULTI 2025)</b> will be a single day
          event to held at the MODELS'25 conference.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>

        <p> Multi-level modeling challenges are designed as benchmark modeling scenarios that aim to support objective
          comparisons
          between multi-level modeling approaches, allow technologies to demonstrate their abilities, stress-test
          technologies in order to expose potential weaknesses, and deepen the mutual understanding of approaches.
        </p>

        <!--
        <p>Multi-level modeling addresses the modeling of subject domains that benefit from an explicit recognition of multiple 
	  levels of domain representation, such as software development, process modeling, capturing organizational roles,
	  biological taxonomies, product hierarchies, and so on. Over the span of two decades many approaches for multi-level
	  modeling have been proposed, all sharing the goal of extending traditional two-level approaches with constructs and 
	  concepts that naturally support multiple levels of domain representation, with the goal to increase model expressiveness while
	  simultaneously reducing model complexity.
        </p>

        <p>Numerous advances in multi-level modeling approaches and tools have, however, lead to a proliferation of available 
	      approaches, thus displaying a lack of consensus on what kinds of constructs and concepts provide the best support
	      for multi-level modeling. In part, differences are owed to different application targets or different prioritizations
	      of desirable model properties, yet not all existing differences can necessarily be motivated in this manner.
	      Some differences at both foundational and realization levels may be perfectly justifiable while others may be
	      reconcilable without diminishing effects.
        </p>
-->

        <h3>Call for Challenges</h3>
        <p>As part of our efforts to get more industry input for the MULTI workshop, we are inviting all
          of you to submit challenges to the <a href="../files/challenges/Industry_Challenge.pdf">Call for the
            Industry
            Challenge</a> we have created.
          We are counting on your expertise and creativity to enrich the workshop’s outcomes. Don’t hesitate to reach
          out if you have any questions or need assistance with your submission.</p>

        <h3>Warehouse Challenge</h3>
        <p> The "Warehouse" challenge references a domain featuring representations of product copies, product
          specifications and product specification types.
          A particular emphasis is on how to guarantee certain properties at the product level without fully determining
          them, in other words, to support flexible but constrained variability.
        </p>
        <p> The submission requirements for the Warehous Challenge and the domain example to use are available from
          the <a href="../files/challenges/MULTI%20Warehouse%20Challenge.pdf">MULTI Warehouse Challenge Description</a>.
          In particular note that submitted solutions must have the subtitle
          "A contribution to the MULTI Warehouse challenge".
        </p>
        <p> If you would like to receive any kind of clarification regarding the challenge requirements, please contact
          the challenge authors who will be more than happy to answer any questions.
        </p>

        <h3>Collaborative Comparison Challenge</h3>
        <p>The Collaborative Comparison challenge aims at improving the mutual understanding of approaches within the
          multi-level modeling community
          by encouraging collaborations which are an opportunity to justify and thus clarify the need for existing
          differences,
          or, alternatively, lead towards homogenizing multi-level modeling.
        </p>

        <p>Towards this end, the Collaborative Comparison Challenge specifically
          requires the application of two or more approaches to a prescribed domain example and mandates the discussion
          of commonalities and
          differences between the approaches in a joint paper authored by proponents of different multi-level modeling
          approaches.
        </p>

        <p>Commonalities and differences should be discussed as they manifest themselves in the conceptualization of the
          domain example
          but also at a more general level. Respective discussion subjects which authors may choose to elaborate on
          include, but are not limited to, fundamental concepts such as the nature of levels, cross-level relationships,
          classification vs generalization, deep characterization, the treatment of attributes and operations, and the
          use
          of structural and behavioral constraints.
        </p>

        <p> Discussions should seek to explore justifications for, and/or potential reconciliations of, fundamental
          differences
          rather than just documenting realization choices. An optional avenue towards contributing to the clarification
          of
          differences is the formalization of foundational concepts, thereby possibly discovering open questions and/or
          potential for unification.
        </p>

        <p> The submission requirements for the Collaborative Comparison Challenge and the domain example to use are
          available from
          the <a href="../files/challenges/MULTI%20Collaborative%20Comparison%20Challenge.pdf">MULTI Comparison
            Challenge Description</a> [1].
          In particular note that submitted solutions must have the subtitle
          "A contribution to the MULTI Collaborative Comparison challenge".
